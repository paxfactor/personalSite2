        <h1 class="mb-5">About Me</h1>
        <div class="mb-5">
        <p>My name is Pax (Latin for peace) Whitmore, and I am an information security professional born and raised in Southern Arizona. I grew up in Tucson and betrayed my childhood by choosing Sun Devils over Wildcats, and I moved to Tempe to attend Arizona State University in 2003. I graduated in 2007 with a BA in Communication and I've been living and working in the Phoenix area ever since. I've been working in IT for over a decade, with the last six years focused exclusively on security.</p>
        <p>While I studied a lot of math and science in high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do in college. My classes were very eclectic, from Italian to the History of Pirates, and I even wrote and student-taught a class called Superheroes in American Culture (back in 2006, well before the mainstream superhero successes of today). My first job out of college was as a photographer and manager for a now-defunct portrait studio company, and it was only through sheer luck that I met people involved in IT security. Even luckier than that, the people I met were very generous with their time and knowledge and lit a fire in my brain that hasn't been doused.</p>
        <p>On the personal side, my interests are pretty intense and varied, including homebrewing, baking, watching movies, reading, photography, and writing. I have an almost encyclopedic knowledge of movies, especially science fiction, and the correct answer to "Kirk or Picard" is "Sisko". I love to read science fiction, political science, history, or physics. I love cars and motorcycles, especially the concept of driving off into the wilderness with nothing but dirt under the tires. Think <a href="https://www.longwayround.com/" target="_blank">Long Way Round</a>, not Car and Driver.</p>
        <p>My personal philosophy comes largely from the great philosopher of our time, The Iron Giant: </p>
